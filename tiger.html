                <h3>Tiger</h3>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a lighter underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and bovids. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support its prey requirements.
                Tigers are native to the tropical forests of Asia, but their range has been drastically reduced over the years. They are now found in fragmented populations across South and Southeast Asia, with the largest populations in India, China, and Russia.
                Tigers are known for their strength, agility, and powerful build. They are excellent swimmers and can climb trees, although they prefer to stay on the ground. Their roar can be heard up to two miles away, making it one of the loudest sounds in the animal kingdom.
                Tigers are also known for their distinctive coat patterns, which vary from individual to individual. These stripes help them blend into their surroundings, making them effective hunters.
                <h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h4>
                You will find the tigers at Tiger Trail, which is located near the entrance of the zoo. The trail features a naturalistic habitat designed to mimic the tiger's native environment, allowing visitors to observe these magnificent creatures in a setting that resembles their wild habitat.
